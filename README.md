# Rigscoin

# NEW:
 - Stealth Addresses<br>
 - Switched to P256 Elliptic Curve Cryptography<br>
 - Changed generation of addresses from SHA256 hash to base58 encoded MD5 hash
<br>

# TODO:
 - Fix Verification<br>
 - Organize<br>
 - Clean Code<br>
 - Decentralization<br>
 - Hide Transaction Ammount<br>
 - Hide Transaction Sender<br>
<br>
 
# NOTES:
 - web.py is the web server to view blockchain, it needs folder "QR" in the same directory.<br>
 - Wallet.py needs "Keys" and "Stealth" in same directory.<br>
 - Code still buggy<br>
 - pipreqs --force<br>
 - For Windows, fastecdsa needs to be fastecdsa-any<br>
<br>

# DESC:

Python Cryptocurrency with stealth addresses<br>
Goal is to have create a cryptocurency that hides transactions totally. <br>
I.E. Cant see ammount sent, to who, or from who.
