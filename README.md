# Rigscoin

# NEW:
 - Stealth Addresses
 - Switched to P256 Elliptic Curve Cryptography
 - Changed generation of addresses from SHA256 hash to base58 encoded MD5 hash
<br>

# TODO:
 - Fix Verification
 - Organize
 - Clean Code
 - Decentralization
 - Hide Transaction Ammount
 - Hide Transaction Sender
<br>
 
# NOTES:
 - web.py is the web server to view blockchain, it needs folder "QR" in the same directory
 - Wallet.py needs "Keys" and "Stealth" in same directory
 - Code still buggy
 - pipreqs --force
 - For Windows, fastecdsa needs to be fastecdsa-any
<br>

# GOAL:
 - Decentralized
 - Anonymous
 - Confidential
<br>

# DESC:

Python Cryptocurrency with stealth addresses.
Goal is to have create a cryptocurency that hides transactions totally.
I.E. Cant see ammount sent, to who, or from who.
